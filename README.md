# learning_reactJs

This repository is a collection of React.js projects built as part of my daily learning journey through the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Each subfolder represents a new day of learning, starting from React basics and gradually covering more advanced concepts.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, reinforce concepts through hands-on practice, and build a solid foundation in frontend development using React.

- **Day1_of_MERN** A time Tracker using useEffect Hook
- **Day2_of_MERN** 
- **Day3_of_MERN**
- **Day4_of_MERN** Background changer On Clicking the different Buttons
- **Day5_of_MERN** Mini Project about when we click On a button 'Click to Show Users' users Data will show using useContext 

More projects will be added as I progress further!
